# DeepLearning

Activities to solve the challenge offered by Kaggle for the identification of pneumonia in radiography images.

The motivation comes from the proposal of Professor Anderson Soares who proposed the challenge in the classroom.

To solve the problem, in this repository contain an artificial machine learning intelligence technique, focused on the recognition of the pattern using deep learning.

At the performance level the image dataset is not available in the repository, and it is available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2/files/41d542e7-7f91-47f6-9ff2-dd8e5a5a7861).
